#### By _**Andrew Kim**_

## Description

_This program will allow a user to select a rapper and will randomly generate one of two opponents. Based on user action on a button click, the math method will be used to determine damage. The victor will be determined by different character attributes such as: special, wordplay, strength, and delivery values. Different pageload or onclick methods are used to incorporate an audio aspect to the project. On initial pageload, a song will play while choosing a character. Once a character is chosen, the music will stop. When "search for rap foe" is clicked, another song will play which represents the battle music. Alert messages will pop up to display user and enemy actions/damage made. HP will also change based on user action. Once one character is defeated, the battle music will stop. An additional lyric API was added to show lyrics on the battle stage using the fetch method._
