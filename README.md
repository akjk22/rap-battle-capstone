# _Pizza Parlor Independent Project_

#### _This project will display knowledge of object oriented Javascript. A user can choose one size and different pizza toppings, and a price will display based on what they chose. 02/19/2020_

## Description

_This program will capture values based on topping and size selections in using css animated checkboxes. Based on what the user chooses, the price will fluctuate and be displayed on the page.
